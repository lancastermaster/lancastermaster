Hi, I’m Everett Lancaster (@lancastermaster).

I'm a college graduate with a bachelor's degree who has always wanted to create my own games and worlds since I was little. 

I’m currently learning the Unreal Engine to build upon my prior education and fill in any blanks that were left after graduation.

My longterm goal for these projects is to learn more with each project, experimenting with new systems and components to eventually create a more complete and professional looking project.

You can reach me via email at lancastermaster@outlook.com.
