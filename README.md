Hi, I’m Everett Lancaster (@lancastermaster).

I'm a college graduate with a bachelor's degree who has always wanted to create my own games and worlds since I was little. 

I’m currently learning the Unreal Engine to build upon my prior education and fill in any blanks that were left after graduation.

I currently have three Unreal Engine projects here, one of which (Dungeon Delve) I am currently working on. 
My longterm goal for these projects is to turn it into a proper game that people find fun to play, and can be excellent addition to a portfolio.

You can reach me via email at lancastermaster@outlook.com.
